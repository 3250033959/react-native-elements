#### Step 1

Install react-native-vector-icons (if you do not already have it)

`npm i react-native-vector-icons --save && react-native link react-native-vector-icons`

*If you have any issues with icons not working or installation of React Native Vector Icons, check out their installation guide [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation)*

#### Step 2

Install React Native Elements

`npm i react-native-elements --save`

or

`yarn add react-native-elements`

#### Step 3

Start using components

## Examples
Check out the pre built and configured [React Native Hackathon Starter Project](https://github.com/dabit3/react-native-hackathon-starter) which uses all of these elements.

## Notes

#### Fonts
React Native Elements uses the System font as the default font family for iOS and Roboto as the default font family for Android.

**In the example screenshots, we are using Lato which can be downloaded [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato).**

> We are working on a way to make a custom font family configurable through the command line.

[Here](https://github.com/dabit3/react-native-fonts) is a list of fonts available out of the box for each platform, or you can install and use a custom font of your own.

To override the fontFamily in any element, simply provide a fontFamily prop:

```js
<Button
  raised
  icon={{name: 'cached'}}
  title='RAISED WITH ICON'
  fontFamily='Comic Sans MS' />

```
